            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am a student at University of Waterloo studying Computer Science looking for Fall 2024 Co ops.</p>
            <p> I have an extensive experience with frontend langauges such as React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS but am also equally versed in C++, Python, SQL, PHP and unfortuantly Racket...</p>
            <p>Within my degree, I have a passion in pure math, which a lot of projects actually draw inspiration from. Feel free to checkout my past projects by navigating to the projects page!</p>

            <p>Outside of my degree my hobbies include, Longboard dancing (although I'm not very good), Skateboarding, Chess (feel free to play a blitz with me) and cooking!</p>

            <h2>Purpose of this website?</h2>
            <p>While a large portion of this website is to showcase my talents and projects in Computer Science, a good bulk of it will be for personal use. Where I'll be documenting my life through my personal blog, uploading new recipes I have discovered (My most famous being a chili oil peanut butter KD Mac and Cheese) or food reviews of restuarants and even my own cooking.</p>

            <h2>A closer look at what each page is going to entail</h2>

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>The page you're looking at! This page has general info about me but also info about this website.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Projects</h4>
                    <p>Take a look at my past projects! Where not only will I be showing them off, but also explaining my processes, tools and techniques I used to get the end product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Resume</h4>
                    <p>This is mostly for if you want to hire me...</p>

                    <h4>Food Reviews (In progress)</h4>
                    <p>Welcome to the only food review site where the reviewer is objectively correct no matter what. Unlike Dave Portnoy, I will be trying a variety of food from pilk (pepsi and milk) to normal people food like pizza or jjajangmyeon and rating them on a scale of 1-10</p>
                    <p>
                        My rating scale is a UNIVERSAL scale with the average (5) being the price and taste of a Big Mac. Anything that is over 5 tastes better or is cheaper than a bigmac and anything under tastes worse or is more expensive than a bigmac.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Recipes (In progress)</h4>
                    <p>Being the only objectively correct food reviewer in the world, it also means that I am exceptionally talented when it comes to cooking. So, when it comes to creating new dishes/recipes I can guarrantee that you will find these original meals, at least a solid 5.</p>
                    <p>From peanut butter mac and cheese to peanut butter broccoli cheddar soup to peanut butter jelly sandwiches. I can truly use almost any ingredient in the kitchen while also mastering any flabvour profile known to man.</p>

                    <h4>Misc (In progress)</h4>
                    <p>Here I will either be reviewing things that aren't food, or I will talking about anything that crosses my mind</p>
